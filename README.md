A shader that can immitate some of Earthbound's battle backgrounds. Made for the Unity Built-in Render Pipeline.

It has uv panning, vertical and horizontal sine wave texture distortion, and fading between 2 textures to sort of immitates pallette swapping to a very limited degree. 

Made with Amplify Shader Editor.
